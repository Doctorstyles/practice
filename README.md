Basic Git and GitHub Workflow

(after a 'git init' in a software project directory)

git add --all (or filename) (stage changes to the index)
git commit -m "Commit Message"
git push -u origin master (to remote repo)

New and/or Modified files -> Staged (git add)
Staged -> Committed (git commit)
Committed -> Pushed (git push)

This is completely different content V1.0
